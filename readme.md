How to run
The actual code (static HTML, JS) for the TensorFlow.js Image Classifier as outlined by the official TensorFlow Documentation resides inside the folder public. No modifications were done to the official code (so far).

The root directory of the repo contains wrapper logic for starting up a web server using Express. To do so, type

npm i
npm start
inside repository root.

This will install Node.js dependencies and start a web server on port 3000 by default.

Open http://localhost:3000 to see the image classifier example in action.
